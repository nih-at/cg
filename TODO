multipart/appledouble: better handling if filename same
binhex support
multiple nntp servers as input
[cleanup nntp support to ease above]
saving parts to files and use as input
remember duplicate parts, sort and failover

---- Before rewrite

* enforce minimum file size, e.g. >1k
* progressbar?

* check if errfilename is set 
* skip rest of stream when filename can't be created (e.g. "xy on 7/8/99.mp3")

* better error messages (partno, lineno, etc.)
* remove/move broken files

* user interface
* newsreader

* filesize (parts same size)

* xref handling

* investigate no end founds
* binhex, mime
* header values

* more smarts in ignoring pointless descriptions
* save part 0
* signature to desc file
