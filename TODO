when articles go missing between selection and download, do not
  download the parts of the articles that are still there
add flag that saves XOVER records to file for remote debugging
test cases: mime: unknown CTE, errors
save additional file with meta information so that one can restart
  cg later and tell it to download the files selected earlier easily

uuencode-base64 support
binhex support
multipart/appledouble: better handling if filename same

stream_quot_print can't handle NUL chars (it returns TOK_LINEs)
handle quoted-printable uuencode stuff
decode(): don't count broken files in return value

multiple nntp servers as input
[cleanup nntp support to ease above]
saving parts to files and use as input
remember duplicate parts, sort (size, author, ...) and failover
enforce minimum file size, e.g. >1k
don't sort user list alphabetically, but by arrival time of last part [optional]
testdec: uudeview replacement

better error messages (partno, lineno, etc.)

user interface
newsreader
progressbar?

xref handling

more smarts in ignoring pointless descriptions
