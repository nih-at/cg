cg is a semi-automatic newsgroup binary downloader.  It assembles
parts based on subject headers and then offers them in an editor for
the user to choose which files he really wants.

It supports decoding data in the following formats:
   uuencode (both single- and multi-posting binaries)
   MIME (multipart/mixed, message/partial;
	 base64, quoted printable, x-uuencode)
   yEnc

Comments in 0-parts or around the encoded data are saved in the file
"filename.desc"; broken files (problems during decoding, missing parts
due to expiration) are saved as "filename.broken".  Files are not
overwritten, rather ".1", ".2", ... is appended to the filename to
make it unique.

The EDITOR and VISUAL environment variables are honored.
Set the NNTPSERVER environment variable to choose your newsserver
(which must support xover records), or use the "-s" flag.

Start it with 'cg somenewsgroup'; `cg -h' offers a short help, should
you need it.
