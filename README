checkgroup is a semi-automatic newsgroup binary downloader.
It assembles parts based on subject headers and then offers
them in an editor for the user to choose which files he really
wants.

For compilation it needs the libmap library.

Start it with 'cg somenewsgroup'; `cg -h' offers a short help,
should you need it.
